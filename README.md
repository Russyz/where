**Where** is a Python Software package used for analyzing geodetic data.
Currently, the software only supports VLBI data, but work is underway also for
other techniques. The Where software is made available to the geodetic community
as an open source, [MIT-licensed](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
project.

See [kartverket.github.io/where](https://kartverket.github.io/where/) for more information.
