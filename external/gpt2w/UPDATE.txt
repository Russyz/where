Installation and update instructions for using the GPT2w library in WHERE
=========================================================================

To download or update the GPT2w library, run the download.py script as follows:

    cd ~/where
    python download.py gpt2w

See the file ~/where/config/download_gpt2w.conf for details about what is being
downloaded.

At first install, we also created and manually updated the gpt2w.pyf-signature
file needed by the F2PY compiler. Creation of the signature file was done as
follows (do NOT do this):

    # cd ~/where/external/gpt2w/src
    # f2py -h ../gpt2w.pyf *.f

You should NOT do this when updating the library, as this will overwrite the
manually updated, existing signature file. Instead, add any new gpt2w routines
to the existing gpt2w.pyf-signature file by hand.

The following manual preparation of the signature file was carried out:

1. Indication if arguments are input or output arguments by using intent(in) or
   intent(out)
 
2. An indication of the resulting module is needed. This is done by adding:
         python module gpt2w ! in
            interface  ! in :gpt2w
                subroutine asknewet(....)
                ...
                end subroutine vmf1_ht
            end interface
         end python module gpt2w

In order to simplify compilation, we have added gpt2w as an external target in
the WHERE Makefile. This will typically not need any changes when updating the
library. This also includes downloading the source code if necessary. Thus, the
library can be updated by running:

    cd ~/where
    make gpt2w
