Installation and update instructions for using the SOFA library in WHERE
=========================================================================

To download or update the SOFA library, run the download.py script as follows:

    cd ~/where
    python download.py sofa

See the file ~/where/config/download_sofa.conf for details about what is being
downloaded.

The version/issue of the SOFA library currently installed can be found in the
00READ.ME file. If a new version is available from the SOFA webpage
(http://www.iausofa.org/) update the version in the download configuration file
~/where/config/download_sofa.conf and run the download script again.

At first install, we also created and manually updated the sofa.pyf-signature
file needed by the F2PY compiler. Creation of the signature file was done as
follows (do NOT do this):

    # cd ~/where/external/sofa/src
    # f2py -c ../sofa.pyf *.for

You should NOT do this when updating the library, as this will overwrite the
manually updated, existing signature file. Instead, add any new sofa routines
to the existing sofa.pyf-signature file by hand.

In order to simplify compilation, we have added sofa as an external target in
the WHERE Makefile. This will typically not need any changes when updating the
library. The Makefile includes downloading the source code if necessary. Thus,
the library can be updated by running:

    make sofa
