Installation and update instructions for using the IERS routines in WHERE
==========================================================================

To download or update the IERS routines, run the download.py script as follows:

    cd ~/where
    python download.py iers_2010

See the file ~/where/config/download_iers_2010.conf for details about what is
being downloaded.

At first install, we also created and manually updated the
iers_2010.pyf-signature file needed by the F2PY compiler. Creation of
the signature file was done as follows (do NOT do this):

    # cd ~/where/external/iers/src_2010
    # f2py -h ../iers_2010.pyf *.F

You should NOT do this when updating the library, as this will
overwrite the manually updated, existing signature file. Instead, add
any new IERS routines to the existing iers_2010.pyf-signature file by
hand.

There are some issues with the downloaded files. These are fixed by applying
patches. The patches are created by

    diff -u file.orig file > file.patch

1. The HARDISP.F is written as a program, and not as a subroutine. We need it
   to be a subroutine. Therefore we changed PROGRAM to SUBROUTINE and removed
   reading of command line parameters. The changes are described in the
   patch-file HARDISP.patch.

2. For proper linking the compiler directive -fPIC needs to be added to the
   makefile of the libiers-hardisp library (at the end of the line starting
   with FF = ...). This change is described in the patch-file
   hardisp-makefile.patch.

3. There seems to be a bug in DAT.F in the libiers-dehant library. In the file,
   CAL2JD is called as iau_CAL2JD (the original name in SOFA). Change the line
   `CALL iau_CAL2JD ...` to `CALL CAL2JD ...` inside DAT.F. This change is
   described in the patch-file dehant-DAT.patch.

4. For proper linking the compiler directive -fPIC needs to be added to the
   makefile of the libiers-dehant library (at the end of the line starting
   with FF = ...). This change is described in the patch-file
   dehant-makefile.patch.

In order to simplify compilation, we have added iers_2010 as an external target
in the WHERE Makefile. This will typically not need any changes when updating
the library. The Makefile includes downloading the source code if
necessary. Thus, the library can be updated by running:

    cd ~/where
    make iers_2010

In the future we may need to support different IERS conventions in addition to
2010. The idea is to keep all files here in different src_yyyy directories,
each compiled to its own python module. The correct one can then be imported
using something like

    from where.ext import iers_2010 as iers
