# This is your personal files configuration file used by Where. Any settings
# here will override the same settings in the main files configuration file
# (files.conf). If you want to change any information about files used by Where,
# you should do it here. Changes in the main configuration file will be
# overwritten when you update Where.

# This file should be named files_local.conf.  Where will first look for this
