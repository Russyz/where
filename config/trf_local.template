# This file should be renamed to trf_local.conf. It may contain local modifications to custom positions used by
# apriori.get('trf', ...)
#
# Each site should be defined as its own section. The section header is used as
# a key in the TRF. It must have a field called pos_itrs, with the
# coordinates. The other fields are made available as meta information.

# Example
#
# [7331]
# cdp           = 7331
# pos_itrs      = 1202462.56765918, 252734.495572318, 6237766.17460896
# name          = NYALES20
# description   = Ny-Ã…lesund custom position
# domes         = 10317
# marker        = S003
