# PRIORITY LIST
#
# The priority list is used for selection of GNSS observation types in Where analysis.
#
# A priority list is given for each GNSS, carrier phase and pseudorange observation type and frequency, following the
# convention:
#
#   <observation code> = <ordered observation types>
#
# The <observation code> definition follows the convention:
#
#   <GNSS>_<L|C><freq>   (e.g. G_L1)
#
#  with
#   GNSS - GNSS constellation given by satellite system identifiers, which follows the RINEX convention (G-GPS,
#          R-GLONASS, E-Galileo, C-BeiDou)
#   L|C  - Carrier-phase or pseudorange observation indicated by L or respectively C
#   freq - Frequency numbers representing single, dual or triple frequency selection. Frequency number and its meaning:
#              1           - observation types definition for single-frequency solution
#              1 and 2     - observation types definition for dual-frequency solution
#              1, 2 and 3  - observation types definition for triple-frequency solution
#
# The <ordered observation types> is the priority list given for a certain <observation code>. The observation type
# defined in the priority list follow the RINEX 2.11 and 3.03 convention. Observation types for RINEX 2.11 and 3.03
# should be defined, because Where can read either RINEX files in RINEX format 2.11 or 3.03. The order of the priority
# list is important for selection of observation type for the Where analysis. Following steps are carried out for the
# selection:
#
#    1. Read RINEX observation files given in format 2.11 or 3.03.
#    2. Get observation types given in RINEX observation file.
#    3. Select observation types given in RINEX file depending on configuration (single- or dual-frequency; code or both
#       code and carrier phase observation) and priority list for further Where analysis. Hereby the first observation
#       type in the priority list, which matches the given RINEX observation types, is selected for the Where analysis.
#
# EXAMPLE:
#
#   Priority list:
#        G_L1    =  L1, L1P, L1C, L1W, L1X
#        G_L2    =  L2, L2P, L2C, L2D, L2S, L2W, L2X
#        G_L3    =  L5, L5Q, L5X
#        G_C1    =  P1,  C1, C1P, C1C, C1W, C1X
#        G_C2    =  P2,  C2, C2P, C2C, C2D, C2S, C2L, C2W, C2X
#        G_C3    =  C5, C5Q, C5X
#
#   The RINEX file is given in RINEX format 2.11 with following GPS observation types C1, C2, C5, P1, P2, L1, L2 and L5.
#   If the configuration options <freq_type = dual> and <code_phase_obs = both> are used, then from the observation
#   codes G_L1, G_L2, G_C1 and G_C2 the observation types L1, L2, P1 and P2 are selected for the Where analysis. If the
#   configuration options <freq_type = single> and <code_phase_obs = code> are used, then from the observation code G_C1
#   the observation type P1 is selected for the Where analysis.
