# This is the WHERE configuration file. It is read and handled by the where.config module, and further documentation
# can be found there.
#
# This file can be named either .whererc, whererc or where.conf.  WHERE will look for this file first in the current
# directory, then in the home direcory of the user, and finally in the system-wide /etc-directory.

# The path section specifies paths to the WHERE work and archive, which is where all files are stored during
# calculations and after archiving, respectively. Furthermore, the data path specifies where to find all input
# data. Most of the actual filenames are specified in files.conf relative to this path. Finally, the where directory is
# used by a few files, but will be set automatically by the program at runtime. Note that if you want to change these
# for a local computer it might be more effective to use a local WHERE configuration file like where_local.conf that
# can be kept outside the version control repository.

#______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
# reference_ellipsoid <ellipsoid>         - Reference ellipsoid definition needed for generation of ellipsoidal
#                                           coordinates. Following reference ellipsoides are defined: grs80, wgs84,
#                                           wgs72.
# write_level         <level>             - Write levels are used to decide which fields of a dataset and other 
#                                           information should be written to disk. Levels can be:
#                                             operational: Write dataset fields, which are used afterwards in the
#                                                          analysis. 'operational' processing uses minial disk memory.
#                                             analysis:    Write dataset fields, which are useful in the analysis
#                                                          either to interpret results or make analyses under
#                                                          processing (e.g. data which can help to identify a clock
#                                                          break in VLBI)
#                                             detail:      Other fields, which are useful (e.g. for debugging)
#
#                                           In addition write levels are used to define, what kind of information are
#                                           written to a Where output file.

# MODELS
#

# Troposphere specification
#
# In priniciple only the mapping function model has to be defined, which are:
#
#     mapping_function:          gmf, gpt2, gpt2w, vmf1_gridded
#
# Depending on the chosen model following meteorological data (MET), zenith hydrostatic
# delay (ZHD), zenith wet delay models (ZWD) and gradient models (GRAD) are used:
#
#    MAP. FUNC     MET           ZHD              ZWD           GRAD
#    ____________________________________________________________________
#    gmf           gpt           saastamoinen     none          apg
#    gpt2          gpt2          saastamoinen     saastamoinen  apg
#    gpt2w         gpt2w         saastamoinen     askne         apg
#    vmf1_gridded  vmf1_gridded  saastamoinen     vmf1_gridded  apg
#
# It is also possible to change the default settings for MET, ZHD, ZWD and GRAD models,
# but this should be done carefully. Not all combinations are possible, for example the
# Askne model for the zenith wet delay determination can only be used together with GPT2w,
# which provides the correct input parameters for the Askne model. Following models
# are available:
#
#     meteorological_data:       gpt, gpt2, gpt2w, site_pressure, vmf1_gridded
#     zenith_hyrdostatic_delay:  saastamoinen
#     zenith_wet_delay:          none, askne, davis, saastamoinen, vmf1_gridded
#     gradients:                 none, apg
